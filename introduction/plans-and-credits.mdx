## Credits

Credits are the unit of usage in Krea. Every time you generate an image, video, or use a real-time tool, credits are consumed. The number of credits depends on the type of task (for example, a high-resolution video frame costs more credits than a small image).

<Info>
Check your credit balance anytime in your account dashboard.

<Tip>
You can top up or upgrade your plan if you run out.
