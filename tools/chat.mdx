The Chat Tool lets you generate and edit images through natural conversation with GPT. Instead of only writing prompts, you can ask the model questions, give instructions step by step, or apply pre-made presets to guide results.

## How to Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Image Tool">
    Available inside the Image Tool.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select GPT Image">
    Select **GPT Image** in the Model Selector.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Chat Panel Opens">
    The Chat panel will appear, allowing you to type messages instead of static prompts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Context Memory

### How Memory Works

<Info>
**Session Context:** The model remembers what you've already asked for within the same session, allowing for:

- **Continuous refinement** without repeating previous instructions
- **Reference to earlier versions** ("go back to the previous style")
- **Building complexity** through multiple conversation turns
- **Contextual understanding** of your preferences and goals
</Info>

### Leveraging Memory

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building on Previous Results">
    **Memory-Driven Workflows:**
    - Reference earlier versions: "Like the first one, but..."
    - Build complexity gradually: "Add to what we have..."
    - Compare iterations: "This version vs. the previous one"
    - Maintain consistency: "Keep the same style but..."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Session Management">
    **Optimizing Sessions:**
    - Keep related requests in the same session
    - Start new sessions for completely different projects
    - Use memory to maintain style consistency
    - Reference specific elements from earlier in the conversation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
