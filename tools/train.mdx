---

The Train Tool lets you teach Krea how to recognize a character, style, or object so you can reuse it in infinite new images and videos. This is useful for product photography, consistent characters, or keeping a unique style across projects.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Train Tool">
    Open Train from the main menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start New Training">
    Click **Train a new model**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload Images">
    Upload a set of images (clear, well-lit examples work best).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Training Type">
    Choose what you're training:
    - **Character** → For people, mascots, or recurring figures
    - **Style** → For a look you want to apply (like a filter)
    - **Object** → For items like products, props, or logos
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name and Train">
    Name your model and start training — it only takes a few minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Trained Models

Once training is complete, your new style will appear in your **Assets → Trained models** list. You can then apply it in different tools:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Image Tool (Flux)" icon="image">
    Use as a style reference when generating new images
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Edit Mode" icon="edit">
    Apply it as guidance for modifications
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Enhancer" icon="sparkles">
    Use it during upscaling to keep a consistent aesthetic
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Video Tool" icon="video">
    Apply it to influence the look and style of videos
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Important:** Trained styles are not standalone "base models." They act as style layers that can be applied across supported tools.
</Info>

## Training Interface

When you open the Train Tool, you'll see:

### Main Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Train a New Model">
    Upload images of a character, style, or object you want to train. Krea will analyze them and create a reusable style in a few minutes.

## Model Options for Training

When you train, you'll first select a base model. This defines how your character, style, or object will learn and generate.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Krea1">
    **Krea's native model.** Balanced and reliable for most training cases.
    
    **Best for:** General use, great if you're unsure where to start
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Flux">
    **Strong model for style fidelity and creative looks.** 
    
    **Best for:** Modern and polished outputs with strong style consistency
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wan 2.1">
    **Earlier open-source model.** Lightweight and useful for experiments.
    
    **Best for:** Quick tests and experimentation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wan 2.2">
    **Improved Wan with sharper details and better generalization.**
    
    **Best for:** More stable results than Wan 2.1
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Qwen">
    **Flexible open-source option.**
    
    **Best for:** Variety and experimentation with different approaches
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Flux Realtime">
    **Optimized for live use.**
    
    **Best for:** Real-time applications (webcam or live prompts)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
**Note:** Once trained, your model can be applied across images, videos, or published content.

## Training Types Explained

### Character Training

<Accordion title="Character Training Best Practices">
  **Purpose:** Create consistent people, mascots, or recurring figures
  
  **Tips:**
  - Keep poses and lighting varied but consistent in subject
  - Include different angles and expressions
  - Maintain consistent character features
  - Use 15-25 high-quality images for best results
</Accordion>

### Style Training

<Accordion title="Style Training Best Practices">
  **Purpose:** Create a reusable visual aesthetic or filter
  
  **Tips:**
  - Focus on consistent visual elements (colors, textures, lighting)
  - Include varied subjects with the same style treatment
  - Ensure consistent artistic approach across all images
  - Works well for artistic styles, photography filters, or brand aesthetics
</Accordion>

## Notes for First-Time Users

<Info>
**Getting Started Tips:**

- **Use at least 10–20 quality images** when training for best results
- **For characters:** Keep poses and lighting varied but consistent in subject
- **For products/objects:** Upload clean, uncluttered backgrounds
- **Training works with supported base models** (Krea1, Flux, Wan, Qwen, Flux Realtime). Results depend on the base model chosen
</Info>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Poor Training Results">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Insufficient or low-quality training images
    - Inconsistent subjects across the dataset
    - Wrong base model selection for your use case
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add more high-quality, consistent images
    - Retrain with a different base model
    - Ensure better consistency in your training set
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Model Not Appearing in Tools">
    **Check:**
    - Training has completed successfully
    - Model is set to "visible" in filters
    - You're using a compatible tool (Image, Video, Edit, Enhancer)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Application Results">
    **Tips:**
    - Adjust prompt strength when applying the model
    - Try different base generation models
    - Combine with specific text prompts for better guidance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Training Strategies

### Multi-Model Training

<Tip>
**Pro Strategy:** Train the same subject on different base models to see which works best for your specific use case. Each base model will interpret your training data differently.
</Tip>

  <Step title="Initial Training">
    Start with your best 10-15 images
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test & Evaluate">
    Generate content using your trained model
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refine Dataset">
    Add more images or remove problematic ones based on results
