---

Video Re-style lets you transform the look of an existing video while keeping the motion and structure intact. Instead of generating new frames from scratch, it applies a new aesthetic on top of your footage.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Video">
    Upload from your computer or select an existing one from your Assets.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload Style Image">
    Import a style reference from your computer. (Note: you cannot pick styles from Krea's default or community styles here â€” only your own uploads are supported).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate">
    Krea applies the style to your video while preserving movement.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and Refine">
    Save, download, or continue refining with other tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>
