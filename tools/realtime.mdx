The Real-time Tool lets you explore ideas instantly. Instead of typing a prompt and waiting for a generation, you see results update live as you type, draw, or adjust controls. It's designed for quick brainstorming, prototyping, and playful exploration.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Real-time">
    Open Real-time from the main menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start with Text">
    Start with a text prompt → results appear instantly as you type.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Switch to Canvas Mode">
    Switch to Canvas Mode to draw shapes, erase, or highlight areas you want the AI to change.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust AI Strength">
    Use the AI Strength slider to control how much the AI follows your input versus inventing new details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save or Send">
    Keep editing in real time until you're happy, then save or send to another tool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes for First-Time Users

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purpose & Scope">
    **Real-time is best for fast ideation, not final renders.** For high resolution, switch to Image Tool or Enhancer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Simplified Controls">
    **The controls are lighter than in other tools** — there's no full model selector, Raw mode, or large resolution picker here.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Progress Saving">
    **Results are saved to Assets** just like normal generations, so you don't lose your progress.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pro Tip">
    **Try combining Canvas Mode + AI Strength** to get more control over what changes and what stays.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Techniques

### Canvas + Text Combination

<Tip>
**Powerful Workflow:** Start with text to establish the general concept, then switch to Canvas Mode to refine specific areas. The AI will interpret both your text prompt and visual edits together.
</Tip>

### AI Strength Experimentation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low Strength (10-30%)">
    - Stays very close to your input
    - Good for precise control
    - Less creative interpretation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Medium Strength (40-70%)">
    - Balanced creativity and control
    - Good starting point for most projects
    - Moderate AI interpretation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="High Strength (80-100%)">
    - More creative AI interpretation
    - Good for exploration and discovery
    - Less predictable results
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
