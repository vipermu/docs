title: "Motion Transfer"
description: "Bring movement from one video and apply it to another image or video"
---

Motion Transfer is a new tool in Krea that lets you bring movement from one video and apply it to another image or video. Think of it like "borrowing" the motion of a source clip and making your own character, object, or image move in the same way.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Motion Source">
    Upload a motion source → This can be a short video of someone dancing, walking, or performing any action.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload Your Target">
    Upload your target → Choose the image or video you want to animate with that motion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate">
    Generate → Krea transfers the motion pattern from the source onto your target, creating a new animated video.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Motion Source Selection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clear, Simple Motions">
    **Works best with clear, simple motions (walking, dancing, hand movements).**
    
    - Choose videos with unobstructed subjects
    - Ensure good lighting and contrast
    - Avoid cluttered backgrounds
    - Select motions that are easy to distinguish
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Quality Considerations">
    - **High-resolution source videos** produce better results
    - **Stable camera work** helps with motion extraction
    - **Consistent frame rate** improves motion smoothness
    - **Good lighting** ensures clear motion detection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Target Content Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Image Targets">
    - Use **high-resolution images** for better detail preservation
    - Ensure the **subject is clearly defined** against the background
    - Consider **pose compatibility** with your motion source
    - **Simple backgrounds** often work better than complex ones
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Video Targets">
    - **Short clips** (under 10 seconds) work best
    - Ensure **consistent lighting** throughout the clip
    - **Stable subjects** transfer motion more reliably
    - Consider the **original motion** when selecting new motion to apply
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Current Limitations

<Warning>
**Important Considerations:**

- **Works best with clear, simple motions** (walking, dancing, hand movements)
- **Complex or overlapping actions** may not always transfer perfectly
- **Output resolution and duration** are capped (will depend on your credits)
</Warning>

### Motion Complexity

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimal Motion Types">
    **Best Results:**
    - Single-person movements
    - Clear, repetitive actions (walking, dancing, waving)
    - Well-lit, unobstructed motion
    - Consistent speed and rhythm
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Challenging Motion Types">
    **May Need Multiple Attempts:**
    - Multi-person interactions
    - Rapid or erratic movements
    - Motion with significant depth changes
    - Actions with complex hand/finger movements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Technical Limitations

<Info>
**Current Technical Constraints:**

- **Processing time** varies based on video length and complexity
- **Credit consumption** depends on output resolution and duration
- **File size limits** apply to both source and target uploads
- **Format compatibility** - ensure your videos are in supported formats
</Info>

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Source Video Tips">
    - **Keep it short** (5-15 seconds) for better processing
    - **Focus on one main subject** performing the motion
    - **Avoid camera shake** or excessive zoom/pan
    - **Use good lighting** to clearly define the moving subject
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Target Selection Tips">
    - **Match the pose** of your target to the source when possible
    - **Consider proportions** - similar body types transfer better
    - **Simple backgrounds** help the algorithm focus on the subject
    - **High contrast** between subject and background improves results
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Experimentation Tips">
    - **Try multiple source videos** with the same target
    - **Experiment with different target poses** for the same motion
    - **Start with simple motions** before attempting complex ones
    - **Combine with other tools** like Enhancer for final polish

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Poor Motion Transfer Quality">
    **Problem:** The motion doesn't transfer well or looks unnatural
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Try a simpler motion source with clearer movement
    - Ensure better lighting in your source video
    - Select a target with similar proportions to the source
    - Experiment with different target poses
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Incomplete Motion Transfer">
    **Problem:** Only part of the motion is transferred
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Use a shorter, more focused motion source
    - Ensure the entire subject is visible in the source video
    - Try a different target image with clearer subject definition
    - Check that both files uploaded completely
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Long Processing Times">
    **Problem:** Motion transfer takes too long to process
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Use shorter source videos (under 10 seconds)
    - Reduce file sizes before uploading
    - Try during off-peak hours for faster processing
    - Consider using lower resolution sources for testing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Future Possibilities
